# Camper-Firmware

Will find a better Projekt name.

## The Idea

The idea is a lightweight gateway to the Camper (systems).  
Now it is Winter and it would be nice to have a warm ass.  
After that it would be cool to know where my Camper is, in case of spontaneous Alzheimer or a bad Person who want also to drive a nice camper.  
Now its warm and save, but i need to move to control the light... thats exhausting. We need some more Systems to control our light, ambient sensors, fans and what ever we think is necessary.  
The additional controllers will communicate over CAN Bus or BLE.  
More interfaces like rs485 for eg solar or battery controller are optional.

## Milestones

1. Turn park heating system on/off via SMS
2. Standalone BLE Ambient Sensor to make the heating system a bit smarter.
3. Little Display and Buttons for system control
4. Send GPS position to trakkar server
5. Send (sensor) data to tbd server
6. Server return path for commands
7. CAN Bus implementation with first simple relay controller node
8. tbd
